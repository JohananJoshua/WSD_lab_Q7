Develop a Web Application that uses AJAX to fetch JSON data from a remote server and displays it on a web page. Fetch a list of fictional books from a JSON API and display them on the webpage.

1. The index.html file contains a button labeled "Fetch Books" and a div element with the id "bookList" where we will display the list of books.
2. Use JavaScript to add a click event listener to the "Fetch Books" button. When the button is clicked, an AJAX request is made to fetch the JSON data from a local file called books.json (you can replace it with your API URL).
3. Once the JSON data is fetched successfully, it's parsed, and the displayBooks function is called to render the list of books on the webpage.
